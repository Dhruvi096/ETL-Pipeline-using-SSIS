ETL Pipeline Using SSIS, SSAS, and Power BI
Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to create an ETL pipeline using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data extraction and loading, SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for creating data cubes, and Power BI for reporting and visualization.

---

Step 1: Create Tables in SQL Server

Objective: Prepare the SQL environment by creating necessary tables to store extracted and transformed data.

Actions:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Connect to your target SQL Server.
3. Execute the SQL scripts to create required tables (from SQL Scripts folder).
4. Verify the tables are created successfully.

Step 2: Configure SSIS Package

Objective: Create and configure an SSIS package to extract data from Excel and load into SQL Server.

Actions:

1. Open the existing SSIS package or create a new one.
2. Update the Excel Source component:
   - Set the Excel file path to the new file location.
   - Ensure the Excel sheet and column mappings are correct.

3. Update the OLE DB Destination:
   - Confirm the server name and database match your current environment.
   - Update the connection string to match the correct server:
     ```
     Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=YOUR_DATABASE;Integrated Security=True;
     ```

4. Save and build the SSIS package.

Step 3: Update Server Name in SSAS

Objective: Connect the SSAS data source to the correct SQL Server.

Actions:

1. Open the SSAS project (Cube or Tabular model).
2. Navigate to Data Source.
3. Right-click → Properties → Modify the server name under the **Connection String**:
   ```
   Provider=SQLNCLI11.1;Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=YOUR_DATABASE;
   ```
4. Deploy the SSAS project to your analysis server.

---

Step 4: Load Data into Power BI from SSAS

Objective: Connect Power BI to the SSAS cube or model for data analysis and visualization.

Actions:

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click on Get Data → Choose SQL Server Analysis Services Database.
3. Enter the Server name where SSAS is deployed.
4. Choose either Connect Live or Import Mode.
5. Select the cube or model.
6. Build visuals and dashboards as needed.

---

Optional: Scheduling & Automation

- Use SQL Server Agent to schedule SSIS package execution.
- Schedule SSAS data refresh as needed.
- Set up Power BI service to refresh reports on a schedule if using imported mode.

Conclusion

This documentation helps establish a basic ETL and reporting workflow using SSIS, SSAS, and Power BI. Ensure all paths, server names, and credentials are updated correctly before deployment. Proper error handling and logging mechanisms should also be implemented in the SSIS packages for production scenarios.
